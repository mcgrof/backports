#
# This file specifies which sources are copied from the kernel
# into the backports package.
#
# Directories must end with a slash (e.g. "net/wireless/") and
# are then copied with all their contents.
#
# It is also possible to rename while copying, to do so list
# old name -> new name
# Note that in this case the spaces are needed: " -> "

# Regulator
# we don't include the whole directory as we need
# rely on your core regulator implementation given that
# it relies on late_initcall() and core_initcall() and
# these can't be backported, as such we need to rely
# on your base kernel regulator implementatin and can
# only extend it with further exports. Your core
# regulator routines are defined via the header file
# include/linux/regulator/consumer.h and dummy.h
